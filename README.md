Machine Learning–Based Traffic Control System
 Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning–Based Intelligent Traffic Control System designed to optimise traffic signal behaviour using data-driven logic. The system supports interactive visualisation, quick demos, and full training modes.
The goal is to demonstrate how AI and ML techniques can be applied to real-world traffic management problems.

Features
•	Intelligent traffic signal decision logic
•	Multiple execution modes (dashboard, demo, training)
•	Interactive dashboard using Streamlit
•	Python-based implementation
•	Beginner-friendly and extensible

 Tech Stack
•	Python
•	Streamlit (for dashboard)
•	Machine Learning concepts
•	Runs on Windows (tested)

 How to Run the Project
1) Interactive Dashboard (Default)
Runs a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard:
streamlit run C:\Users\adity\OneDrive\Desktop\PROJECT_Final\aditya.py

2️) Quick Demo (Console Mode)
Runs a quick demo directly in the terminal:
python C:\Users\adity\OneDrive\Desktop\PROJECT_Final\aditya.py demo

3️) Full Training Mode (Headless)
Runs the complete training process without UI:
python C:\Users\adity\OneDrive\Desktop\PROJECT_Final\aditya.py train

Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed: - Python 3.8+ - Streamlit
Install Streamlit if needed:
pip install streamlit
